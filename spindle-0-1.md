## Goal

Ship Spindle 0.1, a Claude Code function-hooks mod in this repository that shows a pipeline run's lane, stage, MSPs, agents and review verdicts in a band above the prompt, a run pane and toasts, read-only, through the request pipeline's full lane.

## Done when

- [ ] c1 The mod passes claude plugin validate and type-checks
- [ ] c2 claude plugin test covers stage inference and state.json parsing against fixtures shaped like real run homes
- [ ] c3 The band and pane render against a fixture run
- [ ] c4 A pull request is open, opened through the pull-request skill

## Where things stand

Stage 3, round 1 fix pass for MSP spindle on branch mitosis/spindle (base feat/spindle-0-1, round 1 head 1e8876c). Every round 1 blocker and advisory except C3 is fixed with a receipt test; C9 keeps one atom per module because the engine refuses an atom imported from another file. C3 is requirement-wrong; its amendment 1 build (Step second-run, MSP spindle-amend-1) is running in the background.

## Next step

When the amendment 1 build exits, read its last stdout line, merge its branch into mitosis/spindle in the worktree, re-run pipeline obligations with the criteria plus 5.4 and 5.9, then start review round 2 for MSP spindle with previous head 1e8876c.

Needs: D2, D3.

## Decisions in force

- D2 Amendment hand-off: one MSP, spindle, instead of two stacked: One MSP, spindle, one pull request; recorded in the spec as an assumption overriding the two-PR decision and reported as a top risk.
- D3 Amendment 1 hand-off: run found by the session's thread, newest first: Amendment 1: Step second-run in MSP spindle-amend-1, built by amend-1.zsh on branch mitosis/spindle with --no-push, then merged into mitosis/spindle before round 2.

## Open risks

- R1 CI is unproven: claude plugin test on a GitHub runner without a Claude login has never run. Bears on c1.
- R2 Type-check runs only where the engine has laid its types beside the mod; check.sh skips it otherwise. Bears on c1.

## Settled, do not reopen

- S1 The visual design on the Spindle design page (band, pane, crew costumes, art style) is approved by the owner and is not an interview question.
